# ROLEPLAYING GAMES AT VOLKSSOLIDARITÄT BERLIN

VS RPG Berlin is a community of TTRPG enthusiasts, nerds, LARPers, and all in between.

## Where
Games are scheduled on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WGgBGrP8pd) and mainly played in person at two different locations in Friedrichshain.

## Newcomers and Veterans Welcome
We have varying degrees of experience and welcome DMs and players alike. Everyone is free to schedule their own game.

## Self-Organized
Events are self-organized by members who contribute their free time and resources. Volkssolidarität provides the location, but everyone is responsible for making the events fun and smooth-running. No financial profit is involved.
