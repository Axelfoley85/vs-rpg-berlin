# VS RPG Berlin

We are a community of TTRPG enthusiasts, nerds, LARPers, and all in between.

## Newcomers and Veterans Welcome

We have varying degrees of experience and welcome DMs and players alike. Everyone is free to schedule their own game.

## Self-organized

Events are self-organized by members who contribute their free time and resources. Volkssolidarität provides the location, but everyone is responsible for making the events fun and smooth-running. No financial profit is involved.

## Organization via Discord

Games are scheduled on our Discord server and mainly played in person at two different locations in Friedrichshain.
